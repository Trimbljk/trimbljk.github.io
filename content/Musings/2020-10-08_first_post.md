Summary: First post on the new blog! 

Well... I finally did it. It only took me 3 years to learn enough to be comfortable creating my own blog. My name is Jake Trimble and all the information you need to know is [here](https://trimbljk.github.io/about) on my about page. It's pretty cool bringing all my skills together to generate this blog. There will always be more to learn, but at least I can demonstrate those skills by writing. 

This blog, as the title provides, is a data science blog. I intend to post to it when I can and explore cool areas that interest me in the process.
