	<p>This is the first blog post in what will be a series of posts on retrieving, formatting, querying and visualizing data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NSAA). To understand what kinds of data we'll be working with, we can first take a gander over to the NASS quickstats website at <a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/">https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/</a>. The homepage brings up a rather innocuous design:</p>
<p><img alt="usda homepage" src="https://trimbljk.github.io/theme/images/usda_ws_screenshot.png"></p>
<p>You can pick from a variety of options that generates a dataset for perusing. It will be displayed after selecting the <em>Get Data</em> button at the bottom left corner of browser window. You can even download a csv with all the selected values by selecting <em>spreadsheet</em> in the top right corner of your window. Unfortunately, we're only able to work with datasets that contain a max of 50,000 records at a time. </p>
<p>I don't know about you, but any csv or excel file over a 1000 rows is virtually impossible to work with. This isn't a fun way to operate and it doesn't scale if you want to look at the millions of records the NASS database contains. Instead, we're going to use the NASS API to request our desired data and combine it, programmatically, with other data. This gives us the ability to build a much larger dataset. This will be our first step in the process of building a dataset to analyze.</p>
<p>Let's jump start this journey by first navigating to the <em>Developers</em> tab located in the top right corner next to the <em>Help</em> tab. Select <em>Request API Key</em> on the left. Once all the steps are followed, we'll receive a key, via email, that must be provided to each HTTP Request in order to receive the data we desire. I like to set keys to variables in my terminal's shell. As an example, I'll set this key to the variable name: <code>USDAKEY</code>. Setting values like this to the shell environment allows quick retrieval and exporting to common applications, like Jupyter, when programming. More importantly, it hides sensitive credentials from being hard coded. In the next post, I'll discuss the kind of data I'll be collecting.  </p>
