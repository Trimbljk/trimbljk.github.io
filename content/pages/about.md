#### About This Blog

This blog is to help me get better at programming, data science, and my job. You could say this blog is an example of **learning by doing**. I am always willing to accept advice, tips on how to do things better or ideas about what to write next.. 

#### About Me

My name is Jake Trimble and I am a data scientist at AgBiome. AgBiome is a microbial focused, biotechnology company located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. I enjoy learning new programming skills, reading and studying history. I'm fascinated by learning in general. Learning a new concept in programming is very rewarding, especially when you can apply the skill to a project. I would venture to say most programmers understand what I'm talking about, because the feeling is hard to come by in other subjects. It reminds me of the movie _National Treasure_, albeit without Nicholas Cage, where trying to solve an enormous riddle/puzzle that has huge implications for the world, but I digress. I hope you enjoy reading this blog.
