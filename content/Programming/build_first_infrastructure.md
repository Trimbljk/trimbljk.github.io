Before we start gathering data we should build some infrastructure that can handle large amounts and doesn't require our own server. Fortunately, most major tech companies (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) have wonderful cloud-platforms that abstract the hardware allowing others to essentially build any kind of infrastructure to support any application.

We're going to use Amazon Web Service's (AWS) to build the infrasture we need to manage the data we collect.
